# Sendchamp frontend test 

For my submission I have used - Nextjs, Typescript, Chakraui, Recoiljs and React-query.

Although it was a small application, I chose to use these technologies to show my proficiency in different technologies.

## Technologies and structure

Data - stored in a local JSON file from which I fetch the data using React-query and axios.

The application uses custom hooks for queries and other utilities, Ensuring a dry code approach.

Carefully following the UI from the pricing page I was able to recreate it and replicate the subtle animations using Framer motion.
The application is completely styled with Chakraui.

I chose to use Nextjs, because of the benefits that come with it like, SEO, speed and overall developer tooling.

Typescript was a go-to because of the safety that it offers and “super powers” that help me build robust applications.

## Constraints

My submission is coming in by this time, because just as with all applications, challenges must be faced. I attempted to make the application as interactive as possible hence I used data modelled with ChatGPT to feed the application and attempted to alter the displayed prices for services based on user selections.

However because of constraints of time I could not get it to work correctly and had to revert all the code. The data was just a little tricky to use. And I had limited time.

It would have been great to show how I can do that with atoms and selectors. But I chose to prioritise delivering the core concepts over full features at the expense of missing the deadline.

Kindly find bellow a link to the code on my GitHub and live vercel deployment. I hope this submission along side my report shows that I am capable of developing production grade products and that I have good understanding of technologies and architecture and I pay attention to detail. I am open to growth and any suggestion would be greatly appreciated.
